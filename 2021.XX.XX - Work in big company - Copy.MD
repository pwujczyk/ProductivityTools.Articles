# Why it is better to work in big company, from the technical point of view?

I would like to describe tree stories about working in startup and in the big companies. Both of them has their own advantages, but in this article I would like to focus on the learning opportunities.

## Two phases of startups

### Phase 1 - Hurra!
When we are working in the real startup we are coding completely new thing from the ground. It is good and bad. For sure advantage is that we are responsible for everything, the learning curve is very nice and we are gaining new skills every day.

This is also big drawback. We NEED to do everything ourselves. We would like to focus on functionality, but we don't have Identity server so sorry, you need on integration. This often leads to shortcuts, people are not focusing enough and they are doing exactly as it is written in **Getting started** tutorial nothing more. This will have consequences in the future. 

### Phase 2 - structurize

The start-up got bigger. Now it is couple development teams. We cannot work in chaotic environment, we need to organize our work. So we are creating some architecture team, which will coordinate efforts of all people. Who will go to this team? For sure our best people. They know the application they will be the best.

And they are starting to creating the application. The hadn't do it, because if they would probably they wouldn't be in the startup. So they are reading books and creating the state of the art application, which is not very usable, for
