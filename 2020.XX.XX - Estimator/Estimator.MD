Rocket booster separation

Send rocket into space in parts - how to estimate great projects?

The job posters are full of requests for agile, scrum coaches. Now every manager, team lead position in the job poster has information about agile. Current trend is now very clear. We are trying to deliver software in small steps. We took functionality tear it apart into smallest user stories possible and finish one by one. IT commits only to the work planned for the next two weeks. 

This approach is working. Business sees how developers deliver software. IT is predictable and everyone is happy. 

### ...Until something bigger happen

You could be requested for managing a project which is much greater than you usually do and additionally you are asked to answer for simple question: how much it will cost? 
Your current agile methods are not working anymore. You cannot analyze the solution and write exact method names for every tasks. You think that need to perform one hundred sessions of estimations in one week to make estimations.
