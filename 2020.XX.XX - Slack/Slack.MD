# Working with only with slack is possible but only for the best

Every company uses different ways of communication. Ususally 

## Prod issue between pancakes and hot-dogs
In Slack we have a channels. Unusually each team has its own, we have general channel, team-to-team channel and so on. Funny part is that some channels are not 'topic related' but more 'people related'. For example team channel. This means that you are sharing there information, where will you go for lunch, as also that your module on production is not working. 

Unfortunately you need to be up to date with all dishes which bring your team to the office.

## Deals
E-mail is treated as document. Often in e-mail results from discussions are sent. It is treated as a deal. We can save it, print it, mark it with some colour, move to *deals* folder. Basically we have document which will allow us to prove that something were established between parties.

In slack everything is conversation we could make arrangments during that, but it is extra difficult to save it for the future. You can keep this conversation open, but than in one month you will have like thousands open conversations which are not active anymore. Or worse if you will start the conversation again with the same people, your arrangement, will go somewhere up, which will make it much difficult to find

Another options is to open channel for every 'deal-converstion', but people are not doing it. Also this doesn't resolve issue with hundrets of channels

## Threads
When I working with emails, and I have two topics to the same person, I am sending to emails. It is nice, as both topics could have different priority. 

In Slack I would not create a separate channels for those issues, so I started conversation and write in points. Of course we start writing messages, sometimes about one topic, sometimes about the both of them. But in the end I need to remember about both cases.

## Likes
In the Facebook world, everyone likes **likes**. Slack of course also have the ability to like someone statement. 

It generates tree issues:
- next generation people are offended if you won't give them some smart icon when they posted something funny
- you could add icons in the conversation, and it is so easy, that people using it a lot, when I read text every thing is colorful and moving. It is difficult to read the content between small cars and medals which people gives for themselfs
- some poeople accept establishment with an icon. But slack doesn't inform about adding an icon. In email, when I ask somebody about something, the only way him to answer me is to send me an email. I will see it in my inbox and read it. In slack people just add icon, and couple days later I need to go through all request and trying to find icons!

## Traceability
When I write email I can add anybody at any stage of the information exchange. This new participant will have full history (maybe without attachments) of conversation. 

Slack is different. When I start conversation with two people and I would like to add third - new conversation is created, of course without any trace of the previous messages. So all establishments needs to be repeated.

## Not accurate recipients
When I am using e-mails, I am always choose people to which it will be send. In Slack You won't create channel if you would like to send information to 10 people but on channel you have 13. Author of the message thinks: *Those 3 people will know that I don't invite them to the meeting about newest GeForce cards*. It is true I know, but I need to read it.

## Always something to read
On slack I have over 100 channels, not because I like to have a lot, but because sometimes someone publishes there important message. For me it results in messages to be read all the time. I can pospone reading that for some time, but than I need to read a lot messages at the same time. So I have two bad options here. Read messages all the time, and reject not important ones. Or read them in a batch later, but than it is harder.

## You would not now who wrote to you until you will open it, but than it is too late
In Outlook I marked automatically messages from important people, my boss, my introvert friend, who is writing to me only when he had issue and so on.

In slack we have channels and I see only that 'somebody' write something there. I could open it and check, but than something terrible happens, message become 'read' and it disappears in marked channels. 
After checking I could 'star' the message and I am doing it, but later I have stared messages about some excel, and important task to be done. Again I have not priotized list of items...

## Conversation message exchange aka low culture of writing

Slack is chat, very fast and efficient. So why I should write exactly what I need from given person, add pictures and describe exactly what I am expecting. I will throw only a short request, and if he won't understood it he will ask. Unfortunately usually no one understood.

## Memes everywhere

For some time more and more people used memes. In slack it is so easily that for some of the users after writing their name slack adds custom image every time. So Conversation is looking like message, "funny" meme, addidional message, again this funny meme. 

What is more people started to express themselves with pictures. It is something wrong? Maybe not, but I feel that sometimes I am talking with teenagers.

## Emoticons

If you would like to share some information, which should target to wider audience, it is good and expected by others to use as much emoticons  as possible. Than it means that you care and your message is more happy than just simple text . This also invites others to put a lot of different emoticons  under your message .
We are cool  and happy  family, where it is more important to put some heart  into the message than content. (edited)

## Too easy to post
It is so easy to write on Slack, that all just throw important information there. During last covid-remote-war-room everyone was putting important information there, message, comments, diagrams, links. It was like inside no relational database - chaos.
