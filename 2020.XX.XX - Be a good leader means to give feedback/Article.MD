# Be a good leader means to give feedback

I had an couple of the leaders and mentors. All of them were completely different. Couple of them were just great.

## Nike - Just do it yourself
Philip Knight creator of Nike didn't help in any way his first sellers. They were left and needed to resolve all issues by themselves. It worked!

Having a leader who allows to learn by trying and making mistakes learns that knowledge is difficult to achieve and also encourage to experiment. 

Although on the other hand it leads to very slow learning curve. Your manager won't help you, nor drive you in the right direction. 
After changing a job you could have a feeling that you learnt a lot or not, but for sure you haven't learnt anything from your boss. 

This approach also leads to simple conclusion. My manager doesn't know how it should be done. 


## Apple - You did it wrong, do it again

Steave Jobs, doesn't mince words. If he didn't like it he said it. It worked!

Steve often said his opinion in an unpleasant way, but if we will reject this part, having boss which will give you opinion about everything you did it is great opportunity to learn new things. If additionally your manager is able to explain why that approach is better to take than you start thinking about him as a authority. In the next situations you will have you will also ask for help. 

Looking into past for those leaders, I remember that often I needed to redo my work, but I know that those guys, learnt me more than all books I read.

## Microsoft - let's do it differently

Gates was working hand by hand with Paul Allen. They were working toghether. It Worked!

I had been working with other leaders and also in a team with to leaders. It is configuration in which both of the leaders has similar level of knowledge. If you have trust in the relation you can learn a lot as you know that anything you are doing you are scored by the second leader, which will give you feedback in the next occasion.

After it you can say, we were together in this project, we learnt from each other a lot!

## Good leader
- Gives feedback during every occasion
- Allows to make mistakes, but still propose his solution
- Admits if he hasn't knowledge about something
